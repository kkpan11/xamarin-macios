    <summary>A <see cref="UIKit.UIView" /> that displays a search bar.</summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>
   The Xamarin API supports two styles of event notification: the Objective-C style that uses a delegate class or the C# style using event notifications.  
</para>
      <para>
   The C# style allows the user to add or remove event handlers at runtime by assigning to the events of properties of this class.    Event handlers can be anyone of a method, an anonymous methods or a lambda expression.  Using the C# style events or properties will override any manual settings to the Objective-C Delegate or WeakDelegate settings.
</para>
      <para>The Objective-C style requires the user to create a new class derived from <see cref="UIKit.UISearchBarDelegate" /> class and assign it to the <see cref="UIKit.Delegate" /> property.   Alternatively, for low-level control, by creating a class derived from <see cref="Foundation.NSObject" /> which has every entry point properly decorated with an [Export] attribute.   The instance of this object can then be assigned to the <see cref="UIKit.UISearchBar.WeakDelegate" /> property.
