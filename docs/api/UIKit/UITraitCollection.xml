    <summary>Holds the horizontal and vertical size classes, as well as the user interface idiom and the display scale.</summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>
	This class holds the elements describing the user interface
	traits to use to render a view or view controller.  This
	contains components like the size class for the vertical or
	horizontal orientations (which is either compact or regular)
	as well as the user interface idiom (iPad or iPhone form
	factor) as well as the display scale.

      </para>
      <para>
	This is typically used by developers when implementing their
	own <see cref="UIKit.UIViewController" /> as well
	by a handful of classes that are UITraitCollection aware, like
	<see cref="UIKit.UIImage" /> and <see cref="UIKit.UIImageAsset" />.
