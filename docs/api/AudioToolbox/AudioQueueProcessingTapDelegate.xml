    <remarks>
      <para> 
	Call GetSourceAudio until the desired number of audio
	frames required by the tap to work is received.  

      </para>
      <para>
	If the taps are unable to fullfill the requested number of
	frames requested, the AudioQueue will fill the gap with silence.    
      </para>
      <para>
	On entry, the flags might contain a StartOfStream request as
	well as information about what kind of tap this is (running
	before an effect, after an effect or just a Siphon).  Your
	callback can modify the data buffers for non-Siphon cases.
	For Siphon, it should merely examine, but not alter the
	contents.

      </para>
      <para>
	On exit for non-Siphon cases, the flags should be updated with
	StartOfStream and EndOfStream flags depending on the return
	values from <see cref="AudioToolbox.AudioQueueProcessingTap" />'s
	GetSourceAudio method.

      </para>
      <para>
	For non-siphon cases, the tap should allocate the contents of
	the AudioBuffer contents and ensure that they remain valid
	until the next time the Tap callback is invoked.
