    <summary>Used to register a class to the Objective-C runtime.</summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>While all classes derived from the <see cref="Foundation.NSObject" /> class are exposed to
      the Objective-C world, in some cases you might want to expose
      the class using a different name to the runtime.</para>
      <para>
	In addition, if you want your classes to be available on the iOS designer, you need to annotate those classes with the Register attribute.
      </para>
      <example>
        <code lang="csharp lang-csharp"><![CDATA[
// This class is never surfaced to Objective-C's runtime
class NotSurfaced {}

// This class is automatically surfaced to Objective-C's 
// runtime, since it is a subclass of NSObject, and it
// is visible by the Objective-C runtime as "AutomaticallySurfaced"
class AutomaticallySurfaced : NSObject {}

// This class is surfaced to the Objective-C runtime with
// the name 'MyName'
[Register ("MyName")]
