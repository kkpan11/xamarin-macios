	This is a mapping to the Objective-C NSString class.
	Generally, in .NET languages you use the native <see cref="System.String" /> type in your code.  In general, it is
	not worth using NSString in C#/Mono code as the cost of
	marshalling is higher when creating NSStrings manually from a
	C# string than letting the runtime marshal it.   

      </para>
      <para>
	There are a few cases where you will deal with NSString
	objects in MonoTouch.  Those are cases where the NSString is
	used as a handle or token.  That means that the underlying
	platform code is using the address of an NSString as a special
	handle (the code compares strings not by content, but by the
	address).  In those cases, the NSString has been surfaced in
	the MonoTouch binding.  You will typically find those as
	Notification constants or key constants.

      </para>
      <para>
	Another use for NSStrings in C# code is when you want to use
	some localization APIs exposed in NSStrings that map directly
	to the underlying platform localization tables.

      </para>
      <para>
	Code that interoperates with Objective-C automatically converts
	the internal C# string into an NSString.  Sometimes by doing a
	copy of the string, although the runtime supports zero-copy
	marshaling of .NET strings as NSStrings as well

	    This method creates an Objective-C NSString and returns an
	    IntPtr that points to it.  This does not create the managed
	    NSString object that points to it, which is ideal for
	    transient strings that must be passed to Objectiv-C as it is
	    not necessary for Mono's Garbage collector or the
	    MonoTouch/Xamarin.Mac Framework engines to track this object.
	  </para>
          <para>
	    The memory associated with this object should be released
	    by calling the <see cref="Foundation.NSString.ReleaseNative" />
	    method.
