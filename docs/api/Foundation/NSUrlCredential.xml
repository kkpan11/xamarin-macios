    <summary>Authentication credentials</summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>
	Authentication credentials can be created either with a
	username/password pair, a security identity and its certificates
	or based on a server trust authentication (currently, requires a
	handle to the low-level SecTrustRef native handle).
      </para>
      <para>
	NSUrlCredential objects are typically created in the <see cref="Foundation.NSUrlConnectionDelegate.ReceivedAuthenticationChallenge(Foundation.NSUrlConnection,Foundation.NSUrlAuthenticationChallenge)" />
	method and passed to the <see cref="Foundation.NSUrlConnection.UseCredentials" />
	method.
