    <summary>Assembly-level attributed used to inform MonoTouch's linker that this assembly can be safely linked, regardless of the system linker settings.</summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>
	Use this attribute in your assembly if it is safe to perform
	linking on it, regardless of the user default setting to "Link
	only Framework Assemblies.
      </para>
      <para>
	The use case for this attribute are third-party libraries that
	are safe to be linked because they have either safe to be
	linked because they do not depend on members or methods to be
	compiled in to work, or if they do, they used the <see cref="Foundation.PreserveAttribute" /> to preserve those classes. 

      </para>
      <para>
	The default configuration for MonoTouch projects is to link
	only the SDK assemblies, and not link user code or third party
	assemblies.  But many third party assemblies might want to
	reduce their on-disk footprint by informing the linker that
	they are linkable.    Use this attribute in those cases.

      </para>
      <para>
	You do not actually need to take a dependency on the Xamarin
	assemblies, for example, if you are a third-party developer
	that is creating a component or nuget package that is safe to
	be linked, you can just include the LinkerSafe attribute
	source code in your application, and the Xamarin linker will
	recognize it.

      </para>
      <para>
	To use, merely add the following snippet to your source code
	in your assembly:

      </para>
      <example>
        <code lang="csharp lang-csharp"><![CDATA[
[assembly:LinkerSafe]
]]></code>
      </example>
      <para>
	To use in an assembly, without taking a dependency in Xamarin's assemblies:

      </para>
      <example>
        <code lang="csharp lang-csharp"><![CDATA[
class LinkerSafeAttribute : System.Attribute {
    public LinkerSafeAttribute () {}
}

[assembly:LinkerSafe]
]]></code>
      </example>
